                    <p> Hello, I'm Cat! (And I'm an actual person.) </p>
                    <p> I'm a writer, cartoonist and visual journalist attending the University of Florida. I spend my days finishing up my undergraduate degree in journalism, improvising with UF's Theatre Strike Force, and drawing, writing and copyediting for the not-school newspaper, The Independent Florida Alligator. </p>
                    <p>My work is greatly influenced by my childhood. </p>
                    <p>I grew up with my feet in the dirt, my head in a book, and my arms holding a cat.</p> 
                    <p>And since, I have continued to be inspired by nature, story telling, and my feline friends.</p>
                    <p>My cartoons can be child-like. I like to give life and ascribe thoughts to inanimate objects. I also try to use my images to either make comments about life or culture (or just make silly puns and draw cats). </p>
                    <p>Like with my illustrations, I write to communicate information in an engaging way. My favorite topics to cover are social trends, techonology and the environment. My writing style is illustrative with a sense of humour. I also love to express opinions through columns, and movie, music, technology or food reviews.</p>
                    <p>My camera is another medium through which I communicate, either with photography or videography. I feel like this method of story telling is the most truthful. My camera captures authentic moments in people's lives. Of course there are many moments in a person's life, so it is finding the one that says the most that is the trick and the magic.</p>
                    <p>I am motivated by the work of some of my favorite people (though I can't say I've met them, I have admired them from afar): the art and musings of Marc Johns and Christoph Niemann, the journalism careers of Nora Ephron and Ira Glass, the jokes of Mindy Kaling, Amy Poehler and Tina Fey,  and the photography of Brandon Stanton.
