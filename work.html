                     <em>My most recent piece covers the shortage of food in the U.S., as well as its mass waste. I was inspired to write this article based on a September study that showed that about 40 percent of edible food is thrown away. As I am concerned with the environment and social issues, it was important for me to write this story. It is for local literary magazine The Fine Print's upcoming winter issue. I also drew the illustration to accompany the text.</em>
                     
                        <div class="story"> 
                            
                            <img src="img/dumpster_diving.jpg" width="500" height="648" title="dumpster diving" alt="dumpster diving">
                            
                            <p>Dumpster diving is exactly what it sounds like — it is jumping into a pool of trash. Except for this sport, you probably don’t want to go in headfirst, and you really want to wear more protective clothing than just a Speedo — though goggles may not be a bad idea.</p>
                        
                    <p>You may wonder why people pick up dumpster diving. Some do it out of necessity, and others do it because they can. Frank Bouchard was earning his Ph.D. in evolutionary biology at UF, when he used food rescued from Mother Earth’s (currently Earth Origin’s) dumpster to supplement his diet, as well as that of his five roommates. </p>
                        <p>Bouchard would check the dumpster every other night, but he said the process was hit or miss. Only once a week would there actually be something worth going in for.</p>
                        <p>I experienced this firsthand when I went dumpster diving for this story. I was expecting to discover a hidden Garden of Eden, but instead I found a container of cherry tomatoes, a dozen eggs and two microwaveable soy pasta meals. But that is the way of game; you have off-nights. </p>
                        <p>Bouchard said his favorite part about diving was coming home after a big haul and seeing his roommates excited about what he got. Most of the items Bouchard recovered from Mother Earth were packaged groceries like cereal, cookies and other “junk” foods. In addition, he would also check out a local chain grocery store from time to time to get veggie platters and cut fruit. The particular store’s name, however, cannot be revealed for Bouchard knew it was not keen on divers and didn’t want any publicity to cause a dumpster lockdown.</p> 
                        <p>Like Bouchard, some people bypass the front of the stores for the back not only because it’s readily available free food, but because they believe it’s the right thing to do.</p> 
                        <p>According to a September report produced by Harvard and the Natural Resources Defense Council, about 40 percent of food in the United States goes uneaten, and 90 percent of that food is thrown out because of confusion over expiration dates.</p> 
                        <p>“Sell by,” “use by,” or “best before” labels, according to the study, are not meant to indicate the edibility of food, but rather to suggest when food is at its peak quality. According to the NRDC, misunderstandings about food have led to its irresponsible handling.</p>
                        <p>Yet Keith Schneider, 50, associate professor of UF’s Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition said companies are trying to maintain a certain quality level, and they don’t want to give consumers a bad taste experience. For instance, he said if a company that sells crackers extends their product’s shelf life, it might still be edible by the end date, but the crackers may be slightly oxidized and stale.</p>
                        <p>Also, companies may be afraid of being sued, said Schneider. A lot of the time milk is still safe to drink way past the “sell by” date, but corporations don’t want to take the risk of someone becoming sick.
Bouchard said he usually doesn’t pay attention to expiration dates, but rather uses the smell and taste test. He has also never become ill from dumpster diving. </p>
                        <p>Doug Rauch, the former president of Trader Joe’s has recognized the food-waste problem and plans to introduce one possible solution.
Rauch is opening the first market of its kind next year in Dorchester, Mass., that will take perfectly good produce that is slightly past its sell-by date, prepare it into nutritious meals and sell it at discounted prices.</p>
                        <p>Bouchard said he loves the idea and would shop there even if the prices weren’t cheaper, just because it is more sustainable.
Rauch’s idea is kind of like Gainesville’s Repurpose Project, except instead of materials, he is upcycling food. The project is called the Daily Table, and it is not a new idea.</p>
                        <p>Though Rauch will be introducing his repurposed meals in a more mainstream way through a storefront, food banks and dumpster divers have been living off a similar idea for years.</p>
                        <p>Gainesville food banks like Bread of the Mighty rely on the donations of unwanted food from restaurants and grocery stores.</p>
                        <p>Michael Demers, director of development at Bread of the Mighty, said they get donations from stores like Publix, Wal-Mart, Winn Dixie and Trader Joe’s. He said they take food that is “dated,” meaning that it is about to be expired but is still known to be good and safe.</p>
                        <p>When grocers bring in a load, food banks have to handle the food efficiently and safely. It has to be sorted through and distributed quickly to have the greatest shelf life for the individual family. Demers said they also keep their refrigerators cooler in order to increase the food’s shelf life. By setting a fridge at 34 to 36 degrees, rather than 50 degrees, you can get twice the storage life of your groceries.</p>
                        <p>Yet, even with the current donations, Bread of the Mighty is still short of food. The bank serves 50,000 people in five counties, and according to an assessment by Feeding America, it should be bringing in 10 million pounds of food annually to cover the need of those who are considered food insecure, or those who do not know where their next meal is coming from. Currently, the bank produces more than 6 million pounds of food, still falling 4 million short. And out of that percentage, only about 1 million includes produce.</p>
                        <p>Startups like Food Cowboy have jumped on a business opportunity to resolve these food shortages by connecting retailers, truckers and charities, so that more food can be redirected from Dumpsters to hunger relief groups. </p>
                        <p>However, there are still obstacles with rerouting food. Co-founder of Food Cowboy Gordon told NPR that it has been difficult to convince food companies to participate. Even if the chance is one in a million to participate that someone becomes ill or even dies, it could ruin a store’s reputation and cost them millions in court fees. </p>
                        <p>The Good Samaritan Food Donation Act of 1996 may save them from conviction, but it won’t save their business. And though there is a federal tax credit for donations, some retailer’s mind do not think the risk is worth it. In addition, food charities may not be willing to stay open to receive loads on a trucker’s 24/7 schedule. </p>
                        <p>Another possible solution to the problem of food waste, is the reorganization of food labeling. </p>
                        <p>Though associate professor Schneider said he doesn’t believe food companies will extend their “sell by” dates because again, the risk of liability is too great, the NRDC proposes other changes. </p>
                        <p>The council advises the use of “freeze-by” dates in order to extend the shelf-life of food. It also recommends making “sell by” dates visible to the retailer, but not to the consumer because they are more confusing than useful when an individual brings the product home. It advises replacing “sell by” dates with labels indicating the days of shelf-life after opening. </p>
                        <p>But until the system is changed, and for those of us who do not care about getting messy, there is always the Dumpster.
